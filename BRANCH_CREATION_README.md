# Branch Creation Status

## Summary

## What Has Been Done

### 1. Branch Created Locally
The branch `feat/scaffold-setup` has been created locally from commit `10ead07cf9a5e67f00b32b03195c4a2b3879cc4c` (the scaffold commit on main).

```bash
git checkout -b feat/scaffold-setup 10ead07cf9a5e67f00b32b03195c4a2b3879cc4c
```

### 2. Branch Status
- **Branch name**: `feat/scaffold-setup`
- **Based on commit**: `10ead07cf9a5e67f00b32b03195c4a2b3879cc4c`
- **Commit message**: "Add scaffold creation script"
- **Files in commit**:
  - README.md
  - create_scaffold_and_push.sh

### 3. Script Created
A script `push_and_create_pr.sh` has been created that contains the commands needed to:
- Push the `feat/scaffold-setup` branch to origin
- Create a pull request with the specified title and description

## What Needs to Be Done

### Manual Steps Required

Due to authentication limitations in the automated environment, the following steps need to be completed manually by someone with push access to the repository:

#### Step 1: Push the Branch
```bash
cd /path/to/Perple
git fetch origin
git checkout feat/scaffold-setup
git push -u origin feat/scaffold-setup
```

Or simply run the provided script:
```bash
./push_and_create_pr.sh
```

#### Step 2: Verify Branch on GitHub
After pushing, verify the branch exists on GitHub:
https://github.com/dronreef2/Perple/tree/feat/scaffold-setup

#### Step 3: Create Pull Request
Either use the script (which includes `gh pr create`) or create manually via GitHub UI:

**PR Title**: feat(scaffold): move scaffold files to branch for review

**PR Description**:
```markdown
This PR moves the recently added project scaffold (package structure, Emailnator stub, drivers, CI and docs) into a feature branch for review instead of remaining directly on main. The scaffold commit (10ead07cf9a5e67f00b32b03195c4a2b3879cc4c) contains initial files:
- pyproject.toml
- README.md
- .gitignore
- LICENSE
- requirements-dev.txt
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- docs/emailnator.md
- docs/cookie_extraction.md
- perplexity/__init__.py
- perplexity/client.py
- perplexity/integrations/emailnator.py
- perplexity/driver.py
- perplexity_async/__init__.py
- perplexity_async/async_client.py
- create_scaffold_and_push.sh

This PR was created to allow review, add tests, and iterate before merging into main.

Checklist for reviewers:
- [ ] Confirm files and licensing metadata
- [ ] Run tests (pytest) in CI
- [ ] Verify Playwright installation step in CI
- [ ] Ensure no credentials or secrets were committed
- [ ] Update pyproject author and LICENSE text if required

## Technical Notes

### Why Manual Steps Are Needed
The automated environment has the following limitations:
- No GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable set
- Authentication for git push operations fails
- Cannot programmatically create PRs via API

### Branch Information
You can verify the branch status with:
```bash
git branch -a
git log --oneline -1 feat/scaffold-setup
```

Expected output:
```
10ead07 (feat/scaffold-setup) Add scaffold creation script
```

## Verification

After completing the manual steps, verify:
1. Branch `feat/scaffold-setup` exists on GitHub
2. Branch is at commit `10ead07cf9a5e67f00b32b03195c4a2b3879cc4c`
3. PR is created targeting main
4. PR description matches the specified format
