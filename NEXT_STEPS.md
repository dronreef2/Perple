# Next Steps for Completing the Task

## Quick Start

To complete the branch creation and PR setup, run:

```bash
./push_and_create_pr.sh
```

This requires:
- GitHub authentication (gh CLI logged in or GITHUB_TOKEN set)
- Push access to the repository

## What's Already Done

✅ Branch `feat/scaffold-setup` created locally from commit `10ead07cf9a5e67f00b32b03195c4a2b3879cc4c`  
✅ Script created to automate pushing and PR creation  
✅ Documentation created with full PR specification  

## What Needs to Be Done

❌ Push the `feat/scaffold-setup` branch to origin  
❌ Create pull request targeting main  

## Files in This PR

- **push_and_create_pr.sh** - Automated script to push branch and create PR
- **BRANCH_CREATION_README.md** - Detailed documentation and instructions  
- **TASK_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of work completed and limitations encountered
- **NEXT_STEPS.md** (this file) - Quick reference guide

## Why Manual Steps Are Needed

The automated agent environment has these limitations:
1. No GitHub authentication for arbitrary branch pushes via git/bash
2. Cannot create new PRs programmatically (system constraint)

The `report_progress` tool can push, but only to the designated copilot PR branch (`copilot/move-scaffold-files-to-branch`), not to arbitrary branches.

## Alternative: Manual Steps

If you prefer not to use the script:

1. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feat/scaffold-setup
   git push -u origin feat/scaffold-setup
   ```

2. Create PR via GitHub UI with:
   - **Title**: feat(scaffold): move scaffold files to branch for review
   - **Base**: main
   - **Head**: feat/scaffold-setup
   - **Description**: See BRANCH_CREATION_README.md for full text

## Verification

Confirm the branch is correctly set up:
```bash
$ git log --oneline feat/scaffold-setup -1
10ead07 Add scaffold creation script

$ git show 10ead07 --stat
